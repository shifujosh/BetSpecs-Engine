# BetSpecs: Real-Time Analytics Dashboard

> *Financial-terminal style interface for sports analytics.*

## The Problem

Sports data is fragmented across dozens of sources. Odds change by the second. AI tools hallucinate numbers. There is no single place to see the full picture with confidence.

## The Solution

BetSpecs aggregates live data, runs AI analysis, and verifies every output before displaying it.

It is a dashboard where I can see real-time odds, AI-driven insights, and my own performance tracking—all in one view. If the AI says something that does not match the source data, the output is rejected and regenerated.
